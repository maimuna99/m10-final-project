Description:

Simple Note taking is an application designed for  multiple users to add notes both privately & publicly. It provides a database model, multiple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and the ability to host the application locally. The main features of this application include:

User Management: The application stores information about users and provides functionality for user login and logout with authentication.

REST API: The application offers a REST API that allows users to manage both private and public notes. Users can create, retrieve, update, and delete notes through the API.

Database Integration: Notes are stored in MongoDB database, ensuring data persistence and efficient retrieval.

Access Control: The application validates whether a user is allowed to view private notes, ensuring that only authorized users can.
